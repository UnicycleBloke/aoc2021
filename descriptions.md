## Brief descriptions of the puzzle types to aid with recycling code for later days.

- Day 1: Depth soundings for lost keys. Iterate a list to compare adjacent (or at a fixed offset) values.
- Day 2: Regex input for move instructions. Mini-FSM to track position and heading.
- Day 3: Analysis of a set of binary strings "110110111111", ... - the kind of thing Python eats for breakfast.
- Day 4: Squid bingo - read lines in groups to create bingo cards, first line is the series of calls.
- Day 5: Lines of vents - draw lines on the sea floor and count the overlaps. Regex file reader worked like a charm.
- Day 6: Exponential growth of fish population - kind of a lagged Fibonacci series. Must learn to not brute force Part 1!!!
